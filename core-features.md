# 3. Core Features

## 3.1 Neuro Swarm (Connect-to-Earn)&#x20;

### How it Works

Neuro Swarm is Neurolov’s decentralized compute-sharing network where users can contribute idle GPU or CPU power directly from their browser and earn $NLOV tokens in return.

\
There’s no software installation required—just connect your device, start contributing, and earn passively.\
How It Works:

Log in to app.neurolov.ai

Run the automatic compatibility and GPU validation check

Start contributing to AI and compute tasks in real-time

Earn 100–150 NLOV per day per device

Boost earnings via:

Power Hours (2x reward slots)

Leaderboard rankings

Streak bonuses (7-day consistency = extra NLOV)

### Browser Compatibility Check

The platform automatically performs these compatibility checks:

* Supports WebGPU (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
* Falls back to WebGL2 for legacy devices
* Tests GPU VRAM, compute power, and browser settings
* Ensures network stability and upload/download speed
* Adaptive power mode for mobile & low-resource devices

### Resource Sharing Settings

Users can customize their resource contribution:\


* Set GPU usage limits (e.g., 50% or 100%)
* Enable power-saving or turbo mode
* Configure session duration or time windows
* Set thermal safety limits (auto-pause if hot)
* Manage bandwidth usage during contribution

### Earnings Tracking

* Live $NLOV earnings per hour and per task
* Bonus logs (Power Hours, streaks, referrals)
* Task complexity + device power-based reward model
* Daily rewards auto-claimed to your Solana wallet
* Earnings history and contribution stats over time

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 What is Neurolov

Neurolov is a decentralized, browser-powered GPU compute ecosystem that empowers users to either earn rewards by contributing idle device power or create with AI using powerful, affordable GPU resources—no software installation needed.Built on WebGPU + Solana, Neurolov transforms any modern device into an income-generating or AI-powered workstation.We’re building the world's first fully browser-based GPU rental marketplace integrated with an AI model hub, staking system, and gamified compute network.
